# i-plus-interactif-to-pdf (v1.01)

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to resolving the problems of affordability and accessibility associated with online school books by eliminating restrictive DRM (Digital Rights Management) constraints.

## The Challenge

I+ Interactive, an ebook solution, is cumbersome and DRM-restricted. Users are compelled to maintain an active internet connection merely to access their purchased books, which is far from ideal. This project addresses this issue by providing a tool to convert your personal I+ Interactif books into PDF format.
